    <p>
        The Regional Municipality of York, located in the Greater Toronto Area, asked our team to develop a web map
         application to improve the way users can access, query and view roadway construction 
         drawings. These drawings are digital illustrations of the constructed elements of the roadways across the Region of York.
         This product aims to help York Region employees such as Utility Survey 
         Technologists query roadways and their associated construction 
         drawings in a timely manner.</p>

      <p>The objective of this project was to develop a web-based solution that will transform the current 
          road construction drawing retrieval process to one that is better organized, more efficient, 
          and easily accessible. To meet this requirement thorough development of attribute extraction 
          and georeferencing of engineering drawings would be required. For the project to be successful 
          and based on the requirements outlined by York Region the team outlined the following objectives 
          as requirements for a successful solution.  
  
          <p><b>(1) </b>Develop workflows for GIS technical staff to extract attributes and boundaries from construction drawings. The process requires a flexible approach to dealing with a wide range of engineering drawings authored by multiple construction firms while being able to handle large datasets.  
          </p>

        </div>

          <p><b>(2) </b>Store new spatial data in an easy to access format, hosted online. The construction drawing extents are now located in an easy to access area, and in a convenient publicly facing location.  
          </p>

            <img src="photos/storespatial.jpg" alt="Spatial Drawing" style="width:60%">
        </div>

          <p><b>(3) </b>Develop a light weight and straightforward web application to query spatial data. Users can define a region of interest and are returned a list of related construction drawings with associated attributes.  
          </p>

            <img src="photos/geocort.png" alt="Web application" style="width:70%">
        </div>

          <p><b>(4) </b>Provide a comprehensive deliverable package for technical staff to follow workflows, author similar python scripts and publish their own web application. Initial data layers within one database, a final project report, a how-to document and all scripts will be included in the deliverable.  
          </p>
