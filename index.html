    <p>
        The Regional Municipality of York, located in the Greater Toronto Area, asked our team to develop a web map
         application to improve the way users can access, query and view roadway construction 
         drawings. These drawings are digital illustrations of the constructed elements of the roadways across the Region of York.
         This product aims to help York Region employees such as Utility Survey 
         Technologists query roadways and their associated construction 
         drawings in a timely manner.</p>

      <h6 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Attribute Extraction</span></h6>
      
      <p>The attribute extraction process focused on the data available directly from the file name of each PDF file 
        within the project folders. A programmatic approach was selected as most effective as the single layered static images 
        prevented any other form of attribute extraction. With the drawings coming from different engineering companies, writing a 
        Python script allowed for a flexible approach that was needed to ensure all attributes were being captured for each project. 
        A dictionary of key:value pairs which matches the layer fields was created for each PDF and the values NULL was utilized for the 
        instances where the fields vary across the different construction packages. Once the valued attributes are extracted from a PDF file, 
        a new row with that information is inserted into a feature class and given a basic geometry in preparation for the geometry extraction process.  
        </p>

      <h6 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Geometry Extraction</span></h6>
          <p>Through exploration of the CAD drawings, features outlining construction drawing boundaries were manually extracted and converted 
            to features loaded in ArcPro. The features were used to create feature classes at the construction drawing boundary scale. Using the 
            minimum bounding extents of these feature classes, feature classes for the extent of the sub-projects each of those drawings belonged 
            to were created. Once this process was repeated for each drawing in a project, the minimum bounding extents for the sub-project feature 
            classes were used to create an extent for the entire project. This process was repeated for each project provided.  
          </p>

        <h6 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Geometry Update</span></h6>
          <p>Feature classes for three levels of boundaries were created in the geometry extraction process to perform geometry updates at three different 
            stages. Before the update began, a feature class was created containing a row for each PDF file provided with the attributes extracted as 
            fields and each row was assigned the same general polygon. The geometries of this feature class were then updated based on common values
             identified in the feature classes that were selected to perform the update with. First, the update was done with the project boundary
              feature classes, then the sub-project followed by the construction drawing boundary feature classes. Having the three stages of updates 
              allowed the file polygons to be updated with a broad boundary representing the file and then be updated with a more specific boundary
               if one existed.

        <h6 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Geocortex Workflow 5</span></h6>
          <p>We created two custom workflows using Geocortex Workflow 5 to facilitate these processes. The first creates a search form for the user to query the drawing layer of the map, and the second forms a URL to view the user's selected drawing.

        <h6 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Geocortex Web</span></h6>
           <p>We designed and configured a web application in Geocortex Web 5 that allowed users to search and filter the construction drawings and then view them. The application references a web map created in ArcGIS Online.
